ROAD LANE LINE DETECTION
machine learning project using python
• Libraries used: numPy, OpenCV, matplotlib IDE used: Pycharm
• It is critical component for self driving describing the path and avoids
getting in another lane. Developed an algorithm fueled entirely by
computer vision, reading‑decoding files then detecting markings on both
sides on the lane; concepts used : frame masking, region of interest,
grayscale imaging, canny edge detection and hough transformation.
